Fill in the Blanks Quiz v. 1.0 06/03/2016

-------------
GENERAL USAGE
-------------

-To begin, navigate to where you saved fill-in-the-blanks-working.py and
run it in the command line by typing:
<pre><code>python fill-in-the-blanks-working.py
</pre></code>
-You should be presented with 3 levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and
jedi master.

------------
CAPABILITIES
------------

-The quiz has 3 difficulties to choose from: easy, medium, and jedi 
master. Easy and medium deal mostly with Python functions. If you can 
complete jedi master (without using wookiepedia!), you are a true nerd 
and I salute you. Drew Karpyshyn would be proud.

-If you misspell or fat-finger a difficulty entry, you will be gently
prompted to try again. Caps don't matter here.

-Once in the quiz, you should see the most updated version of the quiz
displayed after each answer you type. If you get it wrong, nothing will
change. If you get it right, all the instances of that answer will be
displayed in the updated version (makes for better readability).

-If you misspell or fat-finger an answer, fear not! You have 5 tries per
question to type it right. Answers aren't case-sensitive, either.

-In order to quit the quiz, either answer everything correctly, give 5
incorrect answers in a row, or type Ctrl + C (Windows) or Cmd + C (Mac).
